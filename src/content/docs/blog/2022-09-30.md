## Hello everyone!

I'm Sr Izan, your fellow user and contributor.

Today I'm going to show you how to get started with sern and all its cool features.

### Step 1: Install the CLI.

Install the CLI:

```
npm i -g @sern/cli
```

and then run

```
sern init
```

:::tip
You can also run `sern init -y` if you want to use the default options.
:::

The CLI is written in Typescript and open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/sern-handler/cli). (thanks [evo](https://github.com/EvolutionX-10)!)

### Step 2: Have some way to store secrets.

Normally you'd need a way to store secrets, and the best way to do that is by installing another package: `dotenv`

just `npm i dotenv` in the project folder and add `require('dotenv').config()` to your import section. Then, when you login, `process.env.TOKEN` (or however you have it named on your `.env` file) should do the trick.

:::caution
If you're using ESM, configure dotenv with `import 'dotenv/config'` instead of `require('dotenv').config()`.

### And... that's it?

Yes, that's it. Here's a little FAQ to get you started. You can also join the [Discord](https://sern.dev/discord) for any problems.
