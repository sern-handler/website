This reference will have JavaScript but many snippets are easily transferrable to Typescript.

# why?
There's a **lack of sane ways** to build Discord bots. 
Some advocate to *build your own abstractions*, use clunky archaic codebases that are rarely maintained, or install frameworks that don't satisfy your needs. 

**Keep it simple!**


# sern is built for these things in mind

- **Modularity**: sern is built with modularity in mind. You can swap pieces and parts easily.
- **Familiarity**: Commands and structures are similar to classic v12 handlers and the official Discord.js command handler guide, while packing many features!
- **Concise**: Too much code is a liability. With sern, write less for more. ðŸ¤¯

# Our community

As of 01/23/2025, our [discord](https://sern.dev/discord) is considered small, but it is no excuse for helping those who want to build bots with us. Feel free to join us!
