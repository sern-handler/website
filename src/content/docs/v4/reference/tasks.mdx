Your app may need to execute tasks in the future on intervals or over a long time. 
 If you haven't already, add the `tasks` directory to your [config](/v4/reference/config)

```js
export const tasks = "./dist/tasks"
```

The snippet below defines a task that runs every minute. Keep in mind that the file name is just a unique identifier and you can name it however you want.
```js title="./src/tasks/every-minute.js"
import { scheduledTask } from "@sern/handler";

export default scheduledTask({
    trigger: "* * * * *", 
    execute: (context) => {
        console.log("cron cron")
    }
})
```

The `trigger` is a cron tab pattern, you can edit and test one [here](https://crontab.guru/).

:::tip If you want to cancel a task in the future, you'll need to know it's name! `deps['@sern/scheduler'].kill(uuid)` will kill the task. :::
