:::tip
**TLDR:** Plugins are reusable pieces of code and are installable via `sern plugins` or other sources.
They can modify the module's fields and also perform preconditions.
Put them into the `plugins` field of a [module](/v4/reference/modules). 
:::

## Installation

Chances are, you just want your bot to work. Plugins can preprocess and create reusable conditions for modules.

To install plugins, you can use the CLI:

```sh
sern plugins
```
:::tip 
Feel free to contribute to the [repository](https://github.com/sern-handler/awesome-plugins)!
:::

:::caution
Some plugins only work with specific command types. Most, however, are targeted towards slash / both modules.
:::

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Install your favorite(s) (or the ones that look the coolest).  I installed the `ownerOnly` plugin. 
2. Thank the creator of the plugin. (mandatory)
3. Add the plugin to your module in the `plugins` field.
</Steps>

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts" {6}
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'
import { ownerOnly } from '../plugins'

export default commandModule({
    type: CommandType.Both,
    plugins: [ownerOnly(['182326315813306368'])],
    description: 'ping command',
    execute: (ctx) => {
        ctx.reply('hello, owner');
    }
})
```
┗|｀ O′|┛ perfect, your first plugin!

## Creating Plugins

Plugins are essentially functions that use the controller object to determine whether to continue or stop the execution of a command.

## Init Plugins

Init plugins modify how commands are loaded or do preprocessing.
```ts title="src/plugins/updateDescription.js" {3} {9}
import { CommandInitPlugin } from "@sern/handler";

export const updateDescription = (description: string) => {
  return CommandInitPlugin(({ deps }) => {
    if(description.length > 100) {
        deps.logger?.info({ message: "Invalid description" })
        return controller.stop("From updateDescription: description is invalid");
    }
    module.description = description;
    return controller.next(); // continue to next plugin
  });
};
```
:::warning
You may modify any of the fields of the module, but please careful!
This also includes double checking any plugins which may modify fields of modules.
:::

### User Data 

Each module has a `locals` object which you are free to add custom user data. For example, the localizer AND publisher 
take advantage of this to attach metadata.

```ts title="src/plugins/dateRegistered.js" {3} {9}
import { CommandInitPlugin } from "@sern/handler";

export const dateRegistered = (description: string) => {
  return CommandInitPlugin(({ module, deps }) => {
    module.locals.registered = Date.now() // save module registration date 
    return controller.next(); // continue to next plugin
  });
};
```

## Control Plugins

![control plugins](~/assets/docs/event-plugins.png)


```js
import { CommandControlPlugin } from "@sern/handler";

export const inGuild = (guildId: string) => {
  return CommandInitPlugin(ctx, sdt) => {
    if(ctx.guild.id !== guildId) {
        return controller.stop();
    }
    return controller.next();
  });
};

```
<Steps>
1. An event is emitted by `discord.js`.
2. This event is passed to all control plugins **in order!!**,
3. If all are successful, the command is executed.
</Steps>

:::note
Calling `controller.stop()` notifies sern that this command should not be run, and command is ignored.
:::

:::tip
Control Plugins are good for filtering, preconditions, parsing.
:::


### Controller Object

The controller object is passed into every plugin. It has two methods: `next` and `stop`.

Plugins use the controller to control the flow of the command. For example, if a plugin fails, it calls `controller.stop()` to prevent the command from executing.

```ts
// Reference object, import this from @sern/handler
const controller = {
    next: (val?: Record<string,unknown>) => Ok(val),
    stop: (val?: string) => Err(val),
};
```

### State 
> SDT = **state**, [dependencies](/v4/reference/dependencies), type (very creative) <br/>

Plugins can recieve data from previous plugins. State is created when `controller.next` is called with a record. 
If all control plugins are successful, the final state is passed to the module `execute`.

```js
import { commandModule, CommandControlPlugin, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'

const plugin = CommandControlPlugin((ctx, sdt) => {
    return controller.next({ a: 'from plugin1' });
});
const plugin2 = CommandControlPlugin((ctx, sdt) => {
    return controller.next({ b: ctx.user.id + "from plugin2" });
})

export default commandModule({ 
    type: CommandType.Slash,
    plugins: [plugin, plugin2],
    execute: (ctx, sdt) => {
        sdt.state // { a: 'from plugin1', b: '182326315813306368 from plugin2' }
    }
})
```

:::tip 
State passing is a glorified asynchronous [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce).
:::

#### Caveats
Passing data with the same key will get overridden by the latest plugin. 
It is recommended to **namespace** data keys if you have multiple plugins, or you can ensure no keys are overridden by the 
plugin chain.
```js
return controller.next({ 'cheese-plugin/data' : "From cheese-plugin" })
```

### Dependencies
> SDT = state, **[dependencies](/v4/reference/dependencies)**, type (very creative) 

Plugins also carry an instance of all of your dependencies. Use them and use them as you please! For example,
creating a plugin which logs which user uses your command

```js 
import { commandModule, CommandControlPlugin, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'
export const log = CommandControlPlugin((ctx, sdt) => {
   sdt
   .deps['@sern/logger']
   .info({ message: `${ctx.user.id} used this command from ${ctx.guild.id}` });
})
```
