You're shipped with the `SernEmitter` class. This `EventEmitter` listens to

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Command modules executing and its status; the `module.activate` event
2. Command modules registered and its status; the `module.register` event
3. On default, sern creates a single SernEmitter for your bot process.
4. Any error that occurs; the `error` event
5. `warn` events, where it is possible to throw errors
</Steps>

You can put these and other event listeners into [event modules](/v3/guide/walkthrough/first-event)!

You can view all events in the [`SernEventsMapping`](/v3/api/interfaces/serneventsmapping) interface.
