**TLDR:** Plugins help reduce code repetition and are installable via `sern plugins`. Put them into the `plugins` field of a command/event module.
:::

## Installation

Chances are, you just want your bot to work. Plugins can preprocess and create reusable conditions for modules.

To install plugins, you can use the CLI:

```sh
sern plugins
```

:::caution
Some plugins only work with specific command types. Most, however, are targeted towards slash / both modules.
:::

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Install your favorite(s) (or the ones that look the coolest). In my imaginary mind, I installed the `ownerOnly` plugin. (This should install to `src/plugins`)
2. Add the plugin to your module in the `plugins` field.
</Steps>

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts" {6}
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'
import { ownerOnly } from '../plugins'

export default commandModule({
    type: CommandType.Both,
    plugins: [ownerOnly(['182326315813306368'])],
    description: 'ping command',
    execute: (ctx) => {
        ctx.reply('hello, owner');
    }
})
```

## Creating Plugins

Plugins are essentially functions that use the controller object to determine whether to continue or stop the execution of a command.

### Controller Object

The controller object is passed into every plugin. It has two methods: `next` and `stop`.

Plugins use these methods to control the flow of the command. For example, if a plugin fails, it can call `controller.stop()` to prevent the command from executing.

```ts
export interface Controller {
  next: () => Ok<void>;
  stop: () => Err<void>;
}
```

## Init Plugins

Init plugins modify how commands are loaded or do preprocessing.

An instance of `Controller` (as seen above) is passed into every plugin. This controls whether a module is stored into sern.

```ts title="src/plugins/inDir.ts" {11} {14}
import { CommandInitPlugin } from "@sern/handler";
import path from "path";

export const inDir = (dir: string) => {
  return CommandInitPlugin(({ module, absPath }) => {
    if (path.dirname(absPath) !== dir) {
      console.log(
        Date.now(),
        `${module.name} is not in the correct directory!`,
      );
      return controller.stop();
    }
    console.log(Date.now(), `${module.name} is in the correct directory!`);
    return controller.next(); // continue to next plugin
  });
};
```

:::tip
The plugin above simply checks if the module is in the correct directory. If it's not, it logs a message and stops the command from being loaded.
:::

## Event Plugins

![control plugins](~/assets/docs/event-plugins.png)

<Steps>
1. An event is emitted by `discord.js`.
2. This event is passed to all plugins (**in order!!**),
3. If all are successful, the command is executed.
</Steps>

:::note
Calling `controller.stop()` notifies sern that this command should not be run, and command is ignored.
:::

#### Can you predict the behavior of this command?

<Steps>
1. Before loading into sern, this command module will check if this module is in the correct directory: `other`.
2. Before an event occurs, this command module will check if the user has the id `182326315813306368`.
3. If all plugins return `controller.next()`, this command replies `Pong 🏓`
</Steps>

:::tip
Event Plugins are good for filtering, preconditions, parsing.
