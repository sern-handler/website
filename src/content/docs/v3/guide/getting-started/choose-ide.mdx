Choosing an IDE is a matter of personal preference. They make programming easier. The following are some
suggestions for choosing an IDE:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - We have an [snippet extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SrIzan.sern-snippets) to help automate development :)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [nvim](https://neovim.io/) (chad)
