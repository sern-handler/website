## Introduction

The clear command is a utility that resets all of your commands. It's useful if you accidentally publish the wrong command, such as publishing a guild command globally.

The clear command works by sending an empty array via the [`PUT`](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#bulk-overwrite-global-application-commands) route to the Discord API, for each guild and globally.

To use this command, ensure you have a proper `.env` file in your root directory:

```sh title=".env"
DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
APPLICATION_ID=<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>
NODE_ENV=<development|production>
```

## Usage

```sh
sern commands clear
```

## Notes

- The clear command will prompt you to confirm the action. You can bypass this by using the `-y` flag.
- The clear command will automatically read a `.env` file in the working directory. If you need to override this, you can use the `-e` flag to supply a path to a different `.env` file.
