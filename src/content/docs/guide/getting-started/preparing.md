After installing an IDE, you need to install `node`. Node is necessary to use `sern`, as it's based on `Discord.js`.

You can download Node from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After you've downloaded Node you will need a [Discord token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
